# YouPloader

YouPloader is an Java based, multi platform YouTube uploader aiming to make uploads convenient and manageable.
Inspired by the “Simple Java YouTube Uploader” by Dennis Fischer, which is no longer maintained and relies on Java 7 to work, I set out to create a spiritual successor to this nifty program.
YouPloader is released under the MIT Licence.
Currently YouPloader is in alpha and the first releases have been published!

Translate the strings into your language and save them as lang_(Two char iso code).properties (e.g. lang_fr.properties for France)
Send a pull request and I will happily credit you!
