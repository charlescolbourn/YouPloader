# YouPloader


YouPloader is an Java based, multi platform YouTube uploader aiming to make uploads convenient and manageable.
Inspired by the “Simple Java YouTube Uploader” by Dennis Fischer, which is no longer maintained and relies on Java 7 to work, I set out to create a spiritual successor to this nifty program.
Currently YouPloader is in early development and no releases are available. Look forward to the first release soon.

Here be dragons.
